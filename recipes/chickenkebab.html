    <h2>RECIPE</h2>
    <p>Chicken kebabs are a delicious and flavorful dish that you can easily prepare at home. Here's a simple recipe for
        making chicken kebabs:

        Ingredients:

        500g boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes
        1/4 cup plain yogurt
        2 tablespoons olive oil
        2 tablespoons lemon juice
        2 cloves garlic, minced
        1 teaspoon ground cumin
        1 teaspoon paprika
        1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
        1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
        1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
        1/2 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)
        Salt and pepper to taste
        Wooden or metal skewers</p>

        Instructions:

        In a bowl, combine the yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, ground cumin, paprika, turmeric,
        coriander, ginger, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well to form a marinade.

        Add the chicken cubes to the marinade, making sure they are well coated. Cover the bowl and let it marinate in
        the refrigerator for at least 1 to 2 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor.

        If you're using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 30 minutes before threading the chicken to prevent
        them from burning during cooking.

        Preheat your grill or stovepipe grill pan over medium-high heat. If using an oven, preheat it to 200°C (392°F)
        and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

        If you want to add some vegetables to your kebabs, thread the marinated chicken cubes alternately with sliced
        onions, bell peppers, or cherry tomatoes onto the skewers.

        Grill the chicken kebabs for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and
        has a nice char on the outside. If using an oven, bake the kebabs for approximately 15-20 minutes or until fully
        cooked.

        Once cooked, remove the kebabs from the grill or oven and let them rest for a minute or two.

        Serve the chicken kebabs hot with your favorite side dishes, such as pita bread, rice, salad, or tzatziki sauce.

        Enjoy your homemade chicken kebabs! They make a fantastic appetizer, main course, or party dish that's sure to
        impress your family and friends.
