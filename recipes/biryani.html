        Ingredients:

        1 cup plain yogurt
        1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
        1 teaspoon red chili powder

        1 teaspoon garam masala
        1 tablespoon lemon juice
        Salt to taste
        For the rice:

        2 cups basmati rice, soaked in water for 30 minutes and drained

        Instructions:

        Marinate the chicken:
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric
        powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt. Mix well to ensure the chicken is coated with the marinade. Cover
        the bowl and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or refrigerate it for a few hours for better flavor.

        Cook the rice:
        In a large pot, bring 4-5 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained basmati rice along with bay leaf,
        green cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt. Cook the rice until it's about 70-80% cooked (still
        slightly firm). Drain the rice and set it aside.

        Prepare the biryani:
        In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or a biryani pot, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the thinly sliced
        onions and green chilies. Saut√© until the onions turn golden brown and caramelized.

        Layering the biryani:
        Now, add a layer of marinated chicken to the pot over the caramelized onions. Sprinkle half of the chopped
        cilantro and mint leaves over the chicken. Next, add a layer of partially cooked rice on top of the chicken.
        Sprinkle the remaining cilantro and mint leaves over the rice. Optionally, drizzle the saffron-soaked milk and
        melted butter over the rice. This will add color and fragrance to the biryani.

        Seal the pot:
        Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or use aluminum foil to seal the edges. This will ensure that the steam
        is trapped inside, and the biryani cooks evenly.

        Dum cooking:
        Place the sealed pot on a tawa (griddle) over low heat or on a very low flame. Cook the biryani on "dum" for
        about 25-30 minutes. Dum cooking involves slow cooking over low heat to allow the flavors to meld together.

        Serve:
        Once the dum cooking is complete, remove the pot from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes. Gently fluff
        the biryani with a fork, making sure not to break the rice grains. Garnish with fried onions, fried cashew nuts,
        and raisins if desired.

        Serve the delicious chicken biryani with raita (yogurt-based side dish) or a simple cucumber and tomato salad.
        Enjoy your homemade chicken biryani, a true delight for your taste buds!
