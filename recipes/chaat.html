        Instructions:

        Prepare the papri:
        In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina, baking soda, salt, and vegetable oil. Mix well until
        the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add cold water and knead the dough until it's firm and smooth.
        Cover the dough and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
        Preheat the oven to 180°C (356°F). Roll out the rested dough into a thin sheet and cut it into small, even-sized
        circles or squares. Prick the papris with a fork to prevent them from puffing up while baking. Place the papris
        on a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes or until they turn golden brown and crispy.

        Assemble the papri chaat:
        In a large serving plate or individual bowls, arrange the papris. Top them with boiled chickpeas and diced
        boiled potatoes.
        Drizzle the whisked yogurt over the papris, chickpeas, and potatoes. Follow with tamarind chutney and green
        chutney as per your taste preference.

        Sprinkle chopped onions, tomatoes, green chilies (if using), and fresh coriander leaves over the chaat.

        Generously sprinkle chaat masala, roasted cumin powder, and red chili powder (if desired) over the chaat for
        added flavor.

        Garnish the papri chaat with a handful of sev and pomegranate seeds (if using). Add some chopped fresh mint
        leaves for a refreshing touch.

        Serve the papri chaat immediately and enjoy the explosion of flavors and textures!

        Papri chaat is a delightful appetizer or snack that's perfect for gatherings and parties. It's sure to be a hit
        among your family and friends!
